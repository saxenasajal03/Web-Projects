<h1 style="background-color:azure; text-align:center; color:seagreen; font-family:times new roman; font-size:30px;"> WORK, ENERGY AND POWER </h1>
<h2 style="background-color:purple; text-align:center; color:white; font-family:times new roman; font-size:20px;"> WHAT IS WORK? </h2>
<p cstyle="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">The scientific definition of work is different in many ways from its everyday meaning. The definition of work in physics reveals its relationship to energy - whenever work is done, energy is transferred. 

<br>For a work to be done, in a scientific sense, a force must be exerted and there must be displacement in the direction of the force. With this said, we can say that
<br>Work is the product of the component of the force in the direction of the displacement and the magnitude of this displacement.

<br>Mathematically, the above statement is expressed as follows:

<br><strong>W = (Force)(Displacement) = F. d</strong></p>
<br>

<br>
<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">No work is done if :<br>
(i) the displacement is zero as seen in the
example above. A weightlifter holding a 150
kg mass steadily on his shoulder for 30 s
does no work on the load during this time.
<br>(ii) the force is zero. A block moving on a smooth
horizontal table is not acted upon by a
horizontal force (since there is no friction), but
may undergo a large displacement.
<br>(iii) the force and displacement are mutually
perpendicular. This is so since, for ? = p/2 rad
(= 90o
), cos (p/2) = 0. <br>For the block moving on
a smooth horizontal table, the gravitational
force mg does no work since it acts at right
angles to the displacement. If we assume that
the moon's orbits around the earth is
perfectly circular then the earth's
gravitational force does no work. The moon's
instantaneous displacement is tangential
while the earth's force is radially inwards and
? = p/2.
Work can be both positive and negative. If ? is
between 0o
 and 90o
, cos ? in Eq. (6.4) is positive.
<br>If ? is between 90o
 and 180o
, cos ? is negative.
<br>In many examples the frictional force opposes
displacement and ? = 180o
.<br> Then the work done
by friction is negative (cos 180o
 = -1).
 <br>It is clear that work and energy
have the same dimensions, [ML<sup>2</sup>T<sup>-2</sup>]. The SI unit
of these is joule (J), named after the famous British
physicist James Prescott Joule (1811-1869). Since
work and energy are so widely used as physical
concepts.
<h3> Positive Work </h3>
<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;"> 
 If a force displaces the object in its direction, then the work done is <b>positive</b> <br>
So, W=Fd <br>
<i>The example of this kind of work done is motion of ball falling towards ground where displacement of ball is in the direction of force of gravity.</i>
<center>

</p>
<h3> Negative work </h3>
<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">
If the force and the displacement are in opposite directions, then the work is said to be negative.<br><i> For example if a ball is thrown in upwards direction, its displacement would be in upwards direction but the force due to earth's gravity is in the downward direction.</i>
<br>
<center>
<img src="image/workn.png" style="float: center">
</center>
</p>
<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">
So here in this case gravity is doing negative work when you throw the ball upwards. Hence the work done by gravitational force is negative. Mathematically when displacement is opposite to the force work done is given by <br> <b> * </b> Negative work just means that the force and the displacement act in opposite directions.
</p>

<h3> Example of Work <h3>
<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;"> An object is horizontally dragged across the surface by a 100 N force acting parallel to the surface. Find out the amount of work done by the force in moving the object through a distance of 8 m.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">
<b>Solution</b>: </p>
<p style="font-size:18px; text-align:justify;">
Given: <br>
F = 100 N, d = 8 m <br>Since F and d are in the same direction, ? = 0, [? is the angle of the force to the direction of movement], therefore
<br>W = FdCos ?
<br>W = 100 x 8 x Cos 0
<br>
W = 800 J [Since Cos 0 = 1]</p>
